# CLAUDE.md — FloorTrack

> Flooring & Tile Selection Manager — real web app (React + Vite + Supabase)

This file orients Claude Code (and humans) working in this repo. It reflects the
**deployed web app**, which was ported from the original Claude artifact.

---

## What it is

A single-page business tool for flooring/tile contractors to manage customer
selections by area, auto-calculate grout/mortar quantities, track pricing, save
versions, attach files, and print/export clean estimates. Cloud-synced with
per-user login.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | React 18 (hooks only, no router) |
| Build | Vite 5 |
| Styling | Tailwind 3 + CSS custom properties (Sage & Cream theme in a `<style>` block) |
| Icons | lucide-react |
| Auth | Supabase Auth (email/password, **sign-in only** — accounts created by admin) |
| Data | Supabase Postgres — one `app_data` row per user holding all state as `jsonb` |
| Files | Supabase Storage (private `attachments` bucket, path `<user_id>/<file_id>`) |
| Export | Browser `Blob` + `URL.createObjectURL` (CSV, JSON backup) |
| Print | CSS `@media print` — separate hidden print layout |

> **Differs from the original artifact:** `window.storage` → Supabase; attachment
> bytes → Supabase Storage; the AI "Scan notes" feature is **not** included (it
> needs a server-side API key — see below).

## Data model

Customers live in their own `customers` table (one row each) so they can be
shared; per-user `settings` still live in the `app_data.data` jsonb blob.

```
app_data.data : { settings: Settings }          // per user

customers row : { id (text), owner_id (uuid), visibility:"private|public",
                  data: Customer, created_at, updated_at }

Customer { id, name, address, phone, email, notes, createdAt,
           categories: Area[], versions: Version[], attachments: Att[] }
Area     { id, name, note, products: Product[] }
Product  { id, type:"tile|hardwood|vinyl|laminate|carpet",
           L, W, thickness, sizeText, brandColor, priceSqft,
           qtyType:"sqft|count", qty, note,
           grout:{checked,product,color,joint,manual}, mortar:{checked,product,manual} }
Version  { id, label, savedAt, snapshot: Area[] }
Att      { id, name, type, size }   // file bytes live in Storage, not here
Settings { wastePct, mortars{...}, grouts{...} }
```

**Sharing.** `visibility` is `private` (owner only) or `public` (every signed-in
user can see AND edit it — last-write-wins). RLS enforces this: read = own or
public; edit = own or public; delete = owner anytime, or anyone once a *public*
customer is 30+ days old (from `created_at`); a trigger blocks non-owners from
changing `owner_id`/`visibility`. In memory each customer carries `ownerId` +
`visibility` (stripped out by `custData()` before writing the jsonb). Attachment
files are stored at `<customer_id>/<file_id>` so storage policies can follow the
same rules. Existing data is migrated out of the old `app_data` blob on first
load (`migrateLegacyCustomers`).

## Material math (tile only)

Grout scales volumetrically from a 12×12×3/8" / 1/8"-joint baseline:
```
REF = ((12+12)/(12×12)) × 0.375 × 0.125
vol = ((L+W)/(L×W)) × thickness × joint
coverage = baseCoverage × (REF / vol)
exact = sqft × (1 + wastePct/100) / coverage ;  order = ceil(exact)
```
Mortar uses tiered coverage by tile longest side (`max(L,W)`): `<8"`, `8–15"`,
`>15"`. Both have manual overrides. All rates/prices live in Settings.

The un-rounded "exact" value is always shown next to the rounded order quantity.

## Conventions

- Customer mutations go through `updateCust(id, patch)` → optimistic `setData` +
  an `UPDATE` of that one row's `data`. Sharing changes use `setVisibility`,
  create/delete use `addCustomer`/`delCustomer`, and settings use `setSettings`
  (writes the `app_data` blob). Keep these write paths; don't write ad hoc.
  `updateCust` never sends `owner_id`/`visibility`, so the guard trigger only
  fires for the explicit visibility toggle.
- `normC/normA/normP` and `mergeSettings` normalize loaded/imported data — extend
  these when adding fields so old records stay valid.
- The theme (monochrome, inspired by matthaeusjandl.com) works by **overriding
  Tailwind's slate/indigo classes**. These overrides live in `src/index.css` so
  the login screen (`Auth.jsx`) and the app share one palette. Reuse existing
  utility classes rather than inventing new colors; adjust the `--ft-*` variables
  in `index.css` to retheme.

## Not yet implemented

- **AI "Scan handwritten notes."** Requires the Anthropic API key to live in a
  serverless function (Netlify Function / Supabase Edge Function); the browser
  calls that function, never Anthropic directly. Restrict who can trigger it
  (accounts are already admin-only) and set a spend cap.

Issue tracker
Issues live as local markdown files under `.scratch/NNN_<slug>/` (numbered group directories — see `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`).
When you complete an issue, update its `Status:` field to `done` before committing.
Triage labels
Default canonical label strings (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.
Domain docs
The project's north star lives at `docs/project-charter.md` (what it is, pillars, non-goals); the domain glossary lives at `docs/CONTEXT.md`; functional docs live under `docs/<area>/`. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
Design decisions
Decisions that are hard to reverse, surprising, or trade-off-bearing are recorded as ADRs under `docs/adr/` (system-wide) or `docs/<area>/adr/` (area-scoped), indexed in `docs/adr/README.md`. When a decision lands mid-conversation, use `/decide` to record it and check it against the charter, glossary, and existing ADRs; use `/design-review` for a full pre-implementation grilling. Before contradicting a recorded decision or the charter, surface the conflict rather than silently overriding it.
Code Comments
Be very conservative with comments. Do not explain code that an experienced developer can understand by reading it. Comments should be rare and reserved for non-obvious business rules, surprising constraints, external system quirks, workarounds, or decisions that would look wrong without context. Prefer deleting comments unless they prevent a likely misunderstanding.
